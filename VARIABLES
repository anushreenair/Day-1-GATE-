A variable in C is a named piece of memory which is used to store data and access it whenever required.
It allows us to use the memory without having to memorize the exact memory address.

To create a variable in C, we have to specify a name and the type of data it is going to store in the syntax.
data_type name;

***  A statically typed language is one where the type of every variable is known at compile time â€” before the program runs.
